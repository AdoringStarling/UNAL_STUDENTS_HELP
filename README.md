# UNAL_STUDENTS_HELP
A repository made by a UNAL student to help do some calculations and analysis based in the SIA platform (like PAPA).
In this repository you will be able to export the "Historia Academica" grades and credits table to excel format and 
do some projections with your nowadays and future grades.
